### Questions 

Do we want to pre-genreate whitelist gobblers (and randomly assign on mint) or do we want to generate all of them on the fly? 

Should we buy chainlink and deposit in contract so users don't have to worry about that? 

Tradeoff in customization vs immutability

Philosophy -- 

push as much computation off chain, while keeping the process provably random.
